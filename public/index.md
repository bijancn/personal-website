welcome
-------------------

I just finished my physics studies at the University of Wuerzburg and feel the
[inexplicable] urge to share some information with you honorable visitor. Mainly
it is work that I've done and which might be useful to others or stuff which I'm
frequently asked for.

You can browse through this site or read it as plain text in one [pdf
file](bijancn.pdf). Note, that if you also want all associated files, you should
get the [tar ball](bijancn.tar.gz). Furthermore, you can download any individual
file as `pdf` via the link in the footer.

This site has been created with [Markdown] or more specifically with [Pandoc].
