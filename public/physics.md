## talks

All presentations have been created with the [Beamer][beam] LaTeX class.

### [Checkpointing in CUBA][cuba]

Status report of the six-week *FOKUS research internship* at the [Max
Planck Institute Munich][mpi] with Dr. Thomas Hahn. Main topic is the
implementation of check-pointing, i.e. saving of current progress, for
the [CUBA](http://www.feynarts.de/cuba/) library which offers different
methods for multidimensional numerical integration. (2013, English)

### [Geometric Origin of Scaling in Large Traffic Networks][traffic]

A discussion of the [paper][traffic_paper] by PopoviÄ‡ et al. which shows
that the observed scaling exponents have a geometric origin. A simple
model is studied both analytically and in simulations with agreeing
results for the exponents. Originally prepared for the *FOKUS research
module: Complex Systems* of Prof. H. Hinrichsen, Prof. W. Kinzel and Dr.
J. Reichardt. (2013, English)

### [Symmetry of the Superconducting Gap][supercond]

The first part is a quick reminder of the theory of superconductivity as
mean-field solution. In the second part, the gap function is decomposed
in basis functions with the symmetry of the lattice. Originally prepared
for the *Oberseminar: Symmetries in solid state physics* with Prof. G.
Sangiovanni. (2012, German)

### [Introduction to Quantum Computing][introQC]

A rather basic introduction to quantum computing, originally prepared
for the lecture *Information Theory and Quantum Computing* of Prof. H.
Hinrichsen and Dr. J. Reichardt. (2012, English)

### [Ferromagnetism]

A talk about spin waves, also known as magnons, in the Heisenberg model,
originally prepared for the lecture *Quantum Mechanics III: Many-Body
Physics* of Prof. W.  Hanke. (2012, German)

### [Nonlinear Oscillations][nonlin]

This presentation about nonlinear behaviour, especially in the Duffing
oscillator, contains a video of a rather neat simulation where you can see
chaotic behaviour. It has been created with [Mathematica][math]. The talk also
comes with [proceedings][nonlin_proc] for the interested reader. Originally
prepared for the *Hauptseminar* of PD W. Winter. (2011, German)

write-ups
-----------------

### [Numerical Calculations of Multi-Jet Cross Sections][master_thesis]

My *Master thesis* at TP II: Theoretical Elementary Particle Physics (University
of Wuerzburg), supervised by Prof. Dr. T. Ohl, includes a new computational
method to compute amplitudes with a virtual machine. Furthermore, methods for
the efficient computation of multi-jet cross sections are reviewed, especially
helicity Monte Carlo and QCD antenna phase space sampling. The corresponding
[talk][master_talk] is pending. (2014, English)

### [Decays of the Higgs boson][higgs]

A *Miniresearch Project* about the various decays of the Higgs boson in the
Standard model. Covered are all tree level processes as well as the one-loop
calculation of the decay to two gluons. Finally, the branching ratios are shown
and compared to the [literature][higgs_paper]. (2012, English)

### [Landau levels in bilayer quantum spin Hall systems][bachelor_thesis]

My *Bachelor thesis* at TP IV: Mesoscopic Physics (University of Wuerzburg),
supervised by Prof. Dr. B. Trauzettel and Dr. P. Michetti, provides
a theoretical calculation of the expected experimental results when a strong
magnetic field is applied to a [double quantum well][DQW] with interlayer
voltage. It is shown that the existence of a crossing of `n=0` Landau levels
leads to the same necessary condition for the interlayer voltage as the existing
calculation of the topological invariant. For this work, there is also
a [talk][bachelor_talk] available. (2012, English)
